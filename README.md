# Sokoban.s
A RISC-V Assembly implementation of the classic box-shoving game, Sokoban, I made while taking CSC258 at U of T!

This was my first time writing a game in assembly, and it was quite the exprience. Lots of sleepless nights brought forth the program you see here. 
Would I code a game in RISC-V again? Probably not, however... 

I found the experience helped to further my understanding of how computers work at a lower level. Keep in mind that much of my experience writing programs
before this was largely in interpreted languages such as Python and Java, which enfore memory safety. Working in assembly was the complete opposite - I had to manage
my own memory, and there was a lot to manage. 

## Get Started

The user guide should contain all the information you need to run the game in [CPULator](https://cpulator.01xz.net/?sys=rv32-spim).
